# lab2
In this lab I made a web map with a mapbox tile showing a dark basemap of the world with the cities I travelled to in 2024. The Western hemisphere has markers with images I took when I travelled to certain areas (Banff, Toronto, Ensenada, Machu Picchu). The Eastern hemisphere has a multistring geojson that shows what places I travelled to from Moscow (Sochi, Oludeniz, Amsterdam).
